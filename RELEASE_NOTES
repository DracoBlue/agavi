AGAVI RELEASE NOTES
===================

Version 1.1.0 - August ??, 2009
===============================

Configuration
-------------
All configuration namespaces have been bumped to version 1.1 as a consequence of a version bump in the global "envelope" namespace, which now allows "xml:space" and "ae:literalize" attributes on the <parameter> element to control whitespace trimming and literalizing (conversion of booleans, expansion of configuration directives). Several configuration file namespaces contain new elements or changed behavior as detailed below. The UPGRADING file lists all changes and their implications. New XSL transformations will automatically convert older configuration files to new namespaces and adjust behavior where applicable, allowing you to run your projects with Agavi 1.1 without having to adjust configuration files immediately.

Response
--------
Response classes now extend from AgaviAttributeHolder instead of AgaviParameterHolder. Attributes from each namespace are merged over individually, in the same way as HTTP headers, cookies and other metadata - info from the "child" response does not overwrite info on the response the data is merged to ("parent"). If however the attribute already exists in the parent, and both parent and child value are an array, then those values are merged. In this case, for identical keys, the value from the child array does not overwrite the value from the parent array. Numeric keys, however get appended. You can use this functionality to, for instance, implement caching of metadata such as CSS and JavaScript files to be loaded in the Master template - something that is not possible with global response attribute once you start using such functionality in slots - caching the response attributes would mean corrupt data with slots re-used on different pages.

Routing
-------
AgaviHttpRedirectRoutingCallback allows redirects of matched routes to static URLs or to other routes, including the ability to perform basic rewriting of arguments. The associated ticket #1382 contains further details.

Slots
-----
You can now use array syntax for slot names. Setting slots "foo[0]" and "foo[1]" will result in $slots['foo'][0] and $slots['foo'][1].

Database
--------
Support for Propel versions prior to 1.3 has been dropped from AgaviPropelDatabase. AgaviCreoleDatabase has been removed.

Filters
-------
AgaviIFilter::executeOnce() has been deprecated; in most cases, you can simply use execute() instead, see UPGRADING for further information.

It is now possible to get the global filter chain as well as the filter chain of the current execution container (with the action filter chain) by calling AgaviController::getFilterChain() and AgaviExecutionContainer::getFilterChain(), respectively.

Filter chains now expose an interface to access individual filters by name via AgaviFilterChain::getFilter(); this allows filters to expose an API to adjust runtime behavior (e.g. for AgaviFormPopulationFilter as a more convenient alternative to request attributes). AgaviFilterChain::getType() now returns the type of the filter chain (AgaviFilterChain::TYPE_GLOBAL or AgaviFilterChain::TYPE_ACTION) so dual-use (global and action) filters can detect the calling context.

AgaviReturnArrayConfigHandler
-----------------------------
RACH is now an AgaviXmlConfigHandler and fully namespace aware. Transformations are automatically added in most cases for config files used with previous Agavi versions. Refer to UPGRADING for details.

AgaviSchematronProcessor and AgaviXslProcessor
----------------------------------------------
Both classes have been moved from config/util/ to util/ and decoupled from the configuration system; you can now use them in your application code to perform Schematron validation or XSL transformations.

XInclude Wildcards
------------------
The href attribute of <xi:include /> elements now supports glob() syntax with the GLOB_BRACE flag enabled, so you can do any of the following:
<xi:include href="%core.module_dir%/*/config/routing.xml" />
<xi:include href="%core.module_dir%/{Foo,Bar,Baz}/config/routing.xml" />
<xi:include href="%core.module_dir%/{WinningModule,*}/config/routing.xml" />
For any path matched, the <xi:include /> element will be duplicated with the expanded path inserted into the href attribute.
Duplicates are removed, so the "WinningModule" entry matched by the "*" wildcard alternative in the last example will not be included a second time.
