AGAVI UPGRADING INSTRUCTIONS
============================

Upgrading to 1.1 Series from 1.0 Series
=======================================

Configuration
-------------
All configuration namespaces got bumped to version 1.1. For example, the envelope namespace is now "http://agavi.org/agavi/config/global/envelope/1.1", and the factories.xml namespace is "http://agavi.org/agavi/config/parts/factories/1.1". XSL transformations will automatically port your existing configuration files to new versions and apply backwards compatibility modifications where necessary. If you do not have the XSL extension installed or if you would like to port the configuration files to the new namespace, adjust the namespace declarations accordingly. Occasionally, you will have to add, change or remove elements; new namespace versions may also affect system behavior. All changes that might affect your application are outlined in this file.

Response
--------
If you are using custom implementations of AgaviResponse, please make sure to update the merge() method to call parent::merge(). This method was previously declared abstract, but since Agavi 1.1 it contains the necessary code to perform merging of response attributes.

AgaviReturnArrayConfigHandler
-----------------------------
RACH has been ported to the new-style configuration handler system introduced in Agavi 1.0, and expects your configuration contents to be wrapped in <ae:configurations>/<ae:configuration> elements, like all other Agavi configuration files. The actual content elements must be in no namespace, unless configured otherwise.
To preserve backward compatibility for existing XML files handled by AgaviReturnArrayConfigHandler, Agavi will insert the necessary transformation rules for <handler class="AgaviReturnArrayConfigHandler"> declarations in config_handlers.xml that have no <transformation> children. If you have already <transformation> rules defined for a <handler class="AgaviReturnArrayConfigHandler"> whose configuration files need transforming from old versions, please add
  <transformation>%core.agavi_dir%/config/xsl/rach.xsl</transformation>
to these elements yourself.
The handler is also namespace-aware. By default, it will assume your configuration file's actual contents will be in no XML namespace. If you wish to use an XML namespace for those elements, define the corresponding namespace URI using
  <ae:parameter name="namespace_uri">urn:com.acme.rockets</ae:parameter>
on the affected <handler> elements.
